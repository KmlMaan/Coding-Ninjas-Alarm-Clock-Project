In the Screenshot you can see that we have options for :
1. Set the alarm
2. Delete the alarm &
3. Clear the alarm

Once, the local time is matched with the alarm, it will show an alert message as well as start ringing the mp3 file. 
It will look like this :

Steps involve in making website :
1. First, I have make a HTML file with the help of normal notepad in HTML5 version in a standard form.
2. Making the html body along with the Tags and classes
3. Making a CSS file to design my crazy looking website.
4. Once, the hTML and CSS file is done, i started buiding the jS file for the same.
5. Now, this takes very much time as i don't know few things about some of the topics so,i studied them and made it back.
6. For the testing purpose , i share the source code with my mentors and friends , so making the project a done.
